Thanks to inspiration from everyone at DC25!

Status:
Currently the rev1a board had a ~6 bad traces and had to be fixed.

Board rev1b has all of the traces fixed but I goobered up the pin layout for the Feather 328P.
  1. A couple bodge wires gets it up and running.
  2. I had to stop and laugh. I picked a feather because it has an onboard lipo charger.
     For some reason I had the bright idea to point the USB port at the battery.
     Basically, you can either plug in a battery or USB cable but not booth. Derp.
     Adding a $1.50 usb micro breakout board to the extra space on the feather gave me charging back!
Board rev1c will be finished after the Con. I'll post it up on PCBway if anyone wants to buy and build them.
I'll have the BOM and code here.

Thanks!
Kredence
